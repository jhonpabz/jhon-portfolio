        Back in 2016, during my second year of college as an IT student, there
        was a course introduced to us which is Web Design and Client Side
        Coding. We learn fundamentals which are HTML, CSS, and javascript. I was
        so hooked and researched more about it on the internet. There was a time
        when our professor thought my project was a template/downloaded to the
        internet because of how it looked. That was the time my passion for
        coding started. Whenever there's a group project, my classmates always
        pick me as a leader/programmer. I created an application using Android
        Studio, our Thesis/Capstone project using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP,
        and MySQL.

        After I graduated in 2019, I applied and got my first job as a Web
        Designer at Directories Philippines Corporation. My work there is to
        create a website for Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises(SMSE) here in
        the Philippines using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery. There was a
        time when my manager gave me a project, the BAVA Vehicle Registration
        System. I completed it and felt so happy. I want to return to building
        web applications and have a more challenging job.

      <p className="text-sm text-primary/60 mt-3">
        That's why I applied for my second job as an Associate Software Engineer
        at Fligno Software Philippines Inc. We create web applications for
        clients and stakeholders(99% of our clients here are from Australia). In
        all of the projects I was assigned, my role was more focused on my
        strength which was Front-end. We use React, Redux, React Query, Zustand,
        Material UI, Tailwind, and other new technologies for the Front-end.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-primary/60 mt-3">
        Today, I'm currently working as a Front-end developer in PHILTECH here
        at Makati. We create web apps using Nextjs, React, and Nuxtjs/Vuejs.
