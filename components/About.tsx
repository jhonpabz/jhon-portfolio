        Hi, Iâ€™m Jhon Cesar Pablo, a front-end developer with over 5 years of
        experience and a deep passion for crafting dynamic, user-friendly
        applications. My expertise spans React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        TypeScript, along with popular libraries and frameworks like Vue,
        Next.js, and Nuxt.js.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm text-primary/60 mt-3">
        I specialize in creating responsive designs using Flexbox, GRID,
        SASS/SCSS, and modern UI libraries such as Tailwind CSS, Material UI,
        Daisy UI, Ant Design, and Styled Components. My skill set also includes
        state management tools like Redux, Zustand, and Jotai, as well as
        testing with JEST.

      <p className="text-sm text-primary/60 mt-3">
        While front-end development is my focus, I am also proficient in
        back-end technologies like NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, PHP, Laravel, and
        MySQL.

        implementing a robust project architecture, building reusable React
        components, integrating APIs, configuring Redux/Thunk for efficient
        state management, and ensuring high code quality by sharing best
        practices with co-developers.
