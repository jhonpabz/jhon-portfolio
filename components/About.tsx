        Back in 2016, during my second year of college as an IT student, there
        was a subject introduced to us which is Web Design and Client Side
        Coding. We learn fundamentals which are HTML, CSS, and javascript. I was
        so hooked and researched more about it on the Internet. There was a time
        when our professor thought that my project was a template/downloaded to
        the internet because of how it looked. That was the time my passion for
        coding starts. Whenever there is a group project my classmates always
        pick me as a leader/programmer. I create an app using Android Studio and
        also our Thesis/Capstone project which is created in HTML, CSS,
        Javascript, PHP, and MySQL.

        After I graduated in 2019, I applied and got my first job as a Web
        Designer in DPC. My job there is to create a website for Small and
        Medium-Scale Enterprises(SMSE) here in the Philippines using HTML, CSS,
        Javascript, and JQuery. Then one time our manager gave me a special
        project which is the BAVA vehicle registration system. I finished it and
        I feel so happy I want to go back in building web application and a more
        challenging job.

      <p className="text-sm text-primary/60 mt-3">
        That's why I applied for my second job as a Associate Software Engineer
        in Fligno Software Philippines Inc. We create web apps for for clients
        and stakeholders(99% of our clients here is from Australia). All of the
        project I assigned with, my main role is focuses on my strength which is
        Front end Developer. We use React, Redux, React Query, Zustand, Material
        UI, Tailwind and other new technologies for Front-end.

      <p className="text-sm text-primary/60 mt-3">
        Today I'm currently working as a Front-end developer in PHILTECH here at
        Makati. We create web app. Using Nextjs, React, and Nuxtjs/Vuejs.
