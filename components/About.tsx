        Hi, I’m Jhon Cesar Pablo, a passionate front-end developer with over 6 years of
        experience building modern, user-focused web applications. I’ve worked on a wide
        range of large-scale projects, including fintech platforms, an Airbnb-style storage
        system in Australia, online casino systems, and complex admin dashboards. I also
        have experience collaborating with international teams, particularly developers
        from Taiwan and China.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-primary/60">
        My expertise covers React, Vue, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, as well as
        frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js. I’m skilled in creating responsive,
        high-performance interfaces using Flexbox, GRID, and SASS/SCSS, together with modern
        UI libraries such as Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Daisy UI, Ant Design, and Styled
        Components.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-primary/60">
        For state management and application logic, I’m proficient in Redux, Zustand, and
        Jotai, and I use JEST for testing to ensure code reliability. While front-end
        development is my main focus, I’m also experienced with back-end technologies like
        NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, PHP, Laravel, and MySQL.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-primary/60">
        Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to multiple impactful projects:
      </p>

      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-primary/60">
        At <span className="font-medium">Fun J. Software Development Corp.</span>, I developed and maintained
        React and Vue applications, migrated old platforms, created new features, fixed
        complex bugs, and collaborated closely with cross-functional teams.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-primary/60">
        At <span className="font-medium">Philtech Info Services Inc.</span>, I built a full-scale project from
        scratch using Next.js; designing a scalable architecture, implementing reusable
        React components, integrating REST APIs, and managing state using Redux/Thunk while
        maintaining best practices for clean, efficient code.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-primary/60">
        During my time at <span className="font-medium">Fligno Software Philippines Inc.</span>, I turned creative
        concepts into production-ready applications for projects like Hyperspace Storage,
        Spek, HRIS, and State Planning.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-primary/60">
        My earlier roles at <span className="font-medium">Directories Philippines Corporation (DPC)</span> and
        <span className="font-medium"> One Hundred Services Inc.</span> involved creating and customizing websites
        using CMS platforms and enhancing digital assets.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-primary/60">
        I’m known for my efficiency and ability to deliver high-quality results; I can
        accomplish the workload of several developers by maintaining clean code, reusable
        components, and optimized project structures. I take pride in continuous learning,
        innovation, and a strong commitment to excellence, making me a valuable addition to
        any development team.
